# All of these are used for practice purposes 
## Make File:
## Basically, it checks whether a file exists, or whether
## a file to be made. Then it uses topological sort to 
## Schedule the tasks.

# Syntax
# Target/File: prerequisites
# Command
# Command
# Command

# Target/File: What we are trying to make
# Prerequisites: List of files that are to be used.

# Because there are no dependencies, it doesn't get recompiled
# Everytimes I edit the files. It does so by checking the
# timestamps.

# blah:
# 	cc blah.c -o blah

# all: hello some_file

# hello:
# 	echo "compiling..."
# 	echo "compiled."

# some_file: other_file
# 	echo "This will always run, and runs second"
# 	touch some_file

# other_file:
# 	echo "This will always run, and runs first"

# files := file1 file2
# some_file: $(files)
# 	echo "Look at this variable: " $(files)
# 	touch some_file

# file1:
# 	touch file1
# file2:
# 	touch file2

# # Executes only if called by the command: make clean
# clean:
# 	rm -f file1 file2 some_file

# When there are multiple targets for a rule, 
# the commands will be run for each target. 
# $@ is an automatic variable that contains 
# the target name.

# all: f1.o f2.o

# f1.o f2.o:
# 	echo $@
# # Equivalent to:
# # f1.o:
# #	 echo f1.o
# # f2.o:
# #	 echo f2.o

# files := file1 file2
# some_file: $(files)
# 	echo "Look at this variable: " $(files)
# 	touch some_file

# file1:
# 	touch file1
# file2:
# 	touch file2

# clean:
# 	rm -f file1 file2 some_file

# obj_files = foo.result bar.o lose.o
# src_files = foo.raw bar.c lose.c

# all: $(obj_files)
# # Note: PHONY is important here. Without it, implicit rules will try to build the executable "all", since the prereqs are ".o" files.
# .PHONY: all 

# # Ex 1: .o files depend on .c files. Though we don't actually make the .o file.
# $(filter %.o,$(obj_files)): %.o: %.c
# 	echo "target: $@ prereq: $^"

# # Ex 2: .result files depend on .raw files. Though we don't actually make the .result file.
# $(filter %.result,$(obj_files)): %.result: %.raw
# 	echo "target: $@ prereq: $^" 

# %.c %.raw:
# 	touch $@

# clean:
# 	rm -f $(src_files)

# Define a pattern rule that has no pattern in the prerequisites.
# This just creates empty .c files when needed.
%.c:
