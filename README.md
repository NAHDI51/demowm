# Panther: A tiny paint program aimed to learn X11 and its functionalities.

## Prerequisites
This program must be run from a linux system, because it relies on packages like **X11** (Display Server) and **Sddm** (Display Manager) and the libraries involving them.

## Run the code
We need to use the X11 library as linker in order to run the program. Compiling the program using make will be much easier than manual compilation. Just run
```bash
make
```
